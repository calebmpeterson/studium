        <description><![CDATA[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaca_Da%C4%9F<br><br>AGRICULTURE<br>"The slopes of Karaca Dağ provided the site for the first domestication of einkorn wheat. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne discovered that the genetically common ancestor of 68 contemporary types of cereal still grows as a wild plant on the slopes of Mount Karaca (Karacadag).<br><br>The region is known as the place of origin of different major crops including lentils and chickpeas.<br><br>Karaca Dağ today can be described as a rice mine. Its soil can be described as a layer of soil composed of volcanic lava and deep stone layers, which is highly rich in terms of organic compounds.<br><br>WATER RESOURCES<br>The streams rising from Karaca Dağ are the most significant water sources in the region. There are also a large number of springs on the southern side of Karaca Dağ and in the northern parts of the region.<br><br>Sanliurfa and specifically the Karaca Dağ area are popular for its spring waters which are sold as bottled water to the world.<br><br>The river Khabur originates from a source at the southwestern slope of the Karaca Dağ and flows into the Euphrates further south at Circesium.<br><br>The river Euphrates does not only originate at the confluence of the Karasu river (north) and the Murat river (northeast) in the Armenian highlands of northeastern Turkey, but in its originally predominant source from the northwestern slope of the Karaca Dağ, through what is known today as the Camcayi Creek. [7]<br>The river Tigris does not only originate 74 kms (45 miles) northeast of Diyarbakir and flows through the same city, but it was formerly fed through at least 4 sources from the southeastern slope of the Karaca Dağ, located 33 km (20 miles) southwest of Diyarbakir.

        <description><![CDATA[https://creation.com/karaca-dag<br><br>"10 km north of the site there is a remarkable road grid running north–south and east–west that covers an area 100 km long by 40 km wide. The intersections are aligned to true north with less than half a degree of error. The way these roads were made, and the degree of knowledge of surveying apparent by their accuracy, suggest they are related to the tomb, geoglyphs, and Ark site on the mountain top (figure 7).<br><br>The roads were made by simply removing the loose stones and setting them to the sides. In the areas where the grid crosses fertile soil, the lines have been erased by farming. Where there are outcrops of barren lava flows within the fertile soil, the grid lines are still found. Thus, we conclude these grid lines were made in the far ancient past, though we cannot pinpoint when."]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Rameses / Goshen was an area very close to the River of Egypt, having formed the border with the Philistines.<br><br>Gen 15:18 "On that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram saying, “To your offspring I will give this land, from the RIVER OF EGYPT [clearly not the Nile, but the eastern border of Egypt] to the great river, the Euphrates river, ..."<br><br>Gen 45:10 "And thou shalt dwell in the land of GESEM OF ARABIA ..."<br><br>Gen 46:28-31 "And he sent Judas before him to Joseph, to meet him to the city of HEROES, into the LAND OF RAMESSES.

And the children of Israel departed from RAMESSES, and encamped in Socchot."<br><br>The Bible reflected through the designation 'GOSHEN OF ARABIA' very early, what the Romans would adapt only in 106 AD, when they officially named the Sinai Peninsula "ARABIA".]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Num 21:13–20<br>From there they set out and encamped beyond Arnon, which is in the desert that goes out from the boundary of the Amorites, because Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 14 Therefore thus it is said in the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh, “Waheb in Suphah, and the wadis of Arnon, 15 and the slope of the wadis that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar and lies at the boundary of Moab.”<br>16 From there they went to Beer, which is the water well where Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Gather the people, that I may give them water.” 17 Then Israel sang this song, “Arise, well water! Sing to it! 18 Well water that the princes dug, that the leaders of the people dug, with a staff and with their rods.” And from the desert they continued to Mattanah, 19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the territory of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the surface of the wasteland.]]></description>

There is also an alternative theory that it means 'rocky region'.[5]<br><br>From its mountainous character, it is called the Mount of Gilead (Genesis 31:25; Song 4:1). It is called also the Land of Gilead (Numbers 32:1, Judges 10:4) in many translations, and sometimes simply Gilead (Genesis 37:25; Judges 10:8; Psalm 60:7), also mentioned in Micah 7:14–15.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilead#Etymology]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Excerpt from the study 'End Times', found at www.fitforfaith.ca/studies/#endtimes<br><br>Construction - the walls of the city will be built on the foundation of Christ's church, 'guarded' by the gates of Israel.<br><br>12 Foundations = 12 Apostles, Gentiles<br>12 Gates = 12 Tribes of Israel, Jews<br>12 Precious Stones<br>12 000 Stadia = L*H*W of city (= ~2200 kms)<br>12 x 12 cubits wall thickness<br><br>Rev 21:9-14<br>"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” [...] It has a great and high wall that has twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on the gates which are of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel [...] And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb [...] he measured the city with the measuring rod at twelve thousand stadia [~2200 km]; the length and the width and the height of it are equal. And he measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits [~ 65m] according to human measure, which is the angel’s. And the material of its wall is jasper, and the city is pure gold, similar in appearance to pure glass. The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each one of the gates was from a single pearl. And the street of <br>the city is pure gold, like transparent glass."<br><br>"1. Approx. size and possible location:<br>Many mountains might disappear in the end times, but it is clear that the New Jerusalem will overlap current Israel and it is remarkable that the length of the Red Sea and two of the borders of the Arabian Peninsula almost precisely fit the dimensions provided in Revelation 21. " But the location is unclear and it is not important to know the location. We have to follow Christ with all our heart and the rest will literally fall into place.<br><br>2. It is clear that the New Jerusalem will be located in such a way that it connects the 'western sea' (certainly Mediterranean Sea) and the 'eastern sea' (probably Arabian Sea).<br><br>Zec 14:8 "And then on that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea, and the other half to the western sea; it will happen both in the summer and in the winter."]]></description>

        <name>Jordan - Miracle of Parting the River</name>
        <description><![CDATA[This area shows the mass of water which was held back by the mighty hand of God.<br><br>The crossing of the Jordan river is the most underappreciated miracle in the Bible.<br><br>There was no tide, no elevated seabed and no strong winds, that "facilitated" the previous miracle of crossing the Red Sea partially in a natural way. When the miracle of the Jordan river happened, it was flood season and a 2km wide and 35m deep stream was interrupted 30kms north by the mighty hand of God.<br><br>As if the place would not have already enough relevance, the Bible relates the following events to the very same point of the crossing:<br><br>- John the Baptist baptized here<br>- Jesus and his disciples were baptized here<br>- Jesus's disciples baptized<br>- Elijah parted the waters of the Jordan here<br>- then Elisha parted the waters]]></description>
